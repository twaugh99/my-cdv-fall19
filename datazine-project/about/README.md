A Month of Emails

For this zine, I compiled all the emails that I received for a month.
There wound up being a whopping 350 emails!

I from my data, I discovered a few interesting things about my inbox.

1.) Only 7.4% of my emails were actually directly addressed to me.
2.) 41.7% of my emails were trying to get my to buy something.
3.) I received the majority of my personal spam emails between 3-9 AM while
    received the majority of my school spam emails between 10AM-9PM
4.) Only a handful of them were actually important.

Because I only had a few days to work on this, I had to work fast and in that time I learned a lot.
Most notably, although not a large component of the project, I became much more comfortable with my nemesis --CSS. I really struggled with working with data structures and d3, however by the end I was much more comfortable with them than I was when I started this project.
