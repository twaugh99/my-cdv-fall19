# Week 7 Homework

## Japan's Birthrate
Japan has been dealing with the problem of repopulation recently. While a country needs an average number of children per woman to be 2 in order to maintain its population, Japan only has an average of 1.4 children per woman. This has led to the problem of an aging and shrinking population.

I really like this infographic because it shows lots of different factors that would affect birthrate side to side so it's really easy to identify the causes of this problem.

## Argentina's Inflation Problem
Argentina has had a really hard time with the inflation of its currency considering that the government has defaulted on its debt 8 times, 2 times since 2000. The peso, which was 9 pesos to the dollar in 2015 is now 58 pesos to the dollar.

I think that the infographic that I found is really interesting because it shows the exchange rate of the Argentine peso over time, but it also shows who was president using different colors. This is really important because this issue is largely due to corruption. This website also gives the code of how they created the infographic.
