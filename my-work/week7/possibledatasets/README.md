## Possible Datasets

### Uber
This group of datasets was released by Uber themselves. It includes different datasets from different cities all around the world. You can download different areas and different sections of time. It logs frequency of trips, traffic, and average travel times. I think using different cities' datasets and comparing them side by side would pair well with information about public transportation in a certain place.

### Spotify
This is a dataset of all 574,000 albums that were on the Billboard Top 200 from 1/5/1963 to 1/19/2019. It also includes acoustic data "acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, key, time signature, and valence." as well as, of course, release date. I think that this could be cool if used to track the changes in what people look for in music over time.

### Cereal
Cereal is my favorite food so I really liked this dataset. I am not 100% how I could use this to make a project to the scale of what this assignment is supposed to be, but I had the most fun looking at this dataset.
