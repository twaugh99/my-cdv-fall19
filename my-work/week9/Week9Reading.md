### New Dark Age

*rwanda*

I found this reading very interesting. I especially liked the point about Rwanda where it was argued that the amount of data is not necessary proportional to the amount of good.

*illuminati*

I also really liked heading about the exclusive Google meetings -- that's the closest thing I've ever heard to the illuminati...

*detrimental data*

 Furthermore, the most lasting impressions of this reading on me were about the negative impacts of Data. I especially liked the quote: "We've built modern civilizations on the dialectic that more information leads to better decisions, but our engineering has caught up with our philosophy."
